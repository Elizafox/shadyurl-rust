# This is the .env config file for ShadyURL.
# Configure it to your site needs.
# Be sure to carefully read over each directive.

# Local sitename, if you wish to change it
SITENAME=ShadyURL

# Hostname to use for shady links
SHADY_HOST="localhost:3000"

# Your site's base host, non-shady links
BASE_HOST="localhost:3000"

# IP and port to bind to
BIND="0.0.0.0:3000"

# Source to retrieve client IP's from (case-sensitive)
# Options:
#     - RightmostForwarded: Select the rightmost IP in the Forwarded header
#     - RightmostXForwardedFor: Select the rightmost IP in the X-Forwarded-For header
#     - XRealIp: Select the IP from the X-Real-Ip header
#     - FlyClientIp: Select the IP from the Fly-Client-IP header

#     - CfConnectingIp: Select the IP from the CF-Connecting-IP header
#     - ConnectInfo: Select the IP from the client's raw connection info (default)
#
# When in doubt:
#     - You likely want RightmostXForwardedFor if this is behind nginx or most webservers
#     - If running bare without a server in front, ConnectInfo is what you want (not recommended)
#
# See https://docs.rs/axum-client-ip/latest/axum_client_ip/enum.SecureClientIpSource.html for
# detailed documentation on each option.
